got my local host running in an chrome window
and thats some ui thing i made
for some reason
last night
side bar moves out, and the top buttons show a ribbon like boxarea
originally i was just going to compile some tools that i kee pgoogleing
like a gradient generator
generating that css
and rgb 2 hex
idea was to list icons of the functions on the left
and then the boxes would have the same module
or you could click and it would just be that module
that would store the last generated in a list or something

as a UAP the tiles expand, and it closes with escape, designed to function sorta like cortana
